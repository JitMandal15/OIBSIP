                <section class="about">
                    <p><b>Satyajit Ray</b> was an Indian director, screenwriter, documentary filmmaker, author,
                        essayist,
                        lyricist, magazine editor, illustrator, calligrapher, and composer. Ray is widely considered one
                        of the greatest and most influential film directors in world cinema.[7][8][9][10][11] He is
                        celebrated for works including The Apu Trilogy The Music Room (1958), The Big City (1963) and
                        Charulata (1964) and the GoopyBagha trilogy.
                        Ray was born in Calcutta to nonsense rhyme author Sukumar Ray. Starting his career as a
                        commercial artist, Ray was drawn into independent film-making after meeting French filmmaker
                        Jean Renoir and viewing Vittorio De Sica's Italian neorealist film Bicycle Thieves (1948) during
                        a visit to London.
                        <br>
                        Ray directed 36 films, including feature films, documentaries, and shorts. Ray's first film,
                        Pather Panchali (1955) won eleven international prizes, including the inaugural Best Human
                        Document award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. This film, along with Aparajito (1956) and Apur
                        Sansar (The World of Apu) (1959), form The Apu Trilogy. Ray did the scripting, casting, scoring,
                        and editing, and designed his own credit titles and publicity material. He also authored several
                        short stories and novels, primarily for young children and teenagers. Popular characters created
                        by Ray include Feluda the sleuth, Professor Shonku the scientist, Tarini Khuro the storyteller,
                        and Lalmohan Ganguly the novelist.
                        <br>

                        Ray received many major awards in his career, including a record thirty-six Indian National Film
                        Awards, a Golden Lion, a Golden Bear, two Silver Bears, many additional awards at international
                        film festivals and ceremonies, and an Academy Honorary Award in 1992. In 1978, he was awarded an
                        honorary degree by Oxford University. The Government of India honoured him with the Bharat
                        Ratna, its highest civilian award in 1992. On the occasion of the birth centenary of Ray, the
                        International Film Festival of India, in recognition of the auteur's legacy, rechristened in
                        2021 its annual Lifetime Achievement award to "Satyajit Ray Lifetime Achievement Award".
